This is the repository for code accompanying the paper "Unsupervised cluster analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicates that recent (June 2020) cases in Beijing are from a genetic subgroup that consists of mostly European and South(east) Asian samples, of which the latter are the most recent".
The code provided allows one to re-create the two figures of the paper.
The file "covid.r" creates Figure1.
The file "timeplot.r" creates Figure2.
The two tables "table1.csv" and "table2.csv" contain supplementary data showing what samples are located in the neighborhood of the new China samples.
